# API

Addok exposes an very minimal WSGI interface, you can run it with gunicorn
for example:

    gunicorn addok.http.wsgi

For debug, you can run the simple Werkzeug server:

    addok serve

##Â Endpoints

### /search/

Issue a full text search.

#### Parameters

- **q** *(required)*: string to be searched
- **limit**: limit the number of results (default: 5)
- **autocomplete**: activate or deactivate the autocompletion (default: 1)
- **lat**/**lon**: define a center for giving priority to results close to this
  center (**lng** is also accepted instead of **lon**)
- every filter that has been declared in the [config](config.md) is available as
  parameters

##### Multi-value filters

Filters support multiple values with OR logic using the `+` separator. For example:

```
/search/?q=Paris&type=street+city
```

This will return results where the type is either "street" OR "city".

You can combine multiple filters with AND logic:

```
/search/?q=Paris&type=street+city&postcode=75001
```

This will return results where:
- type is "street" OR "city" (OR logic)
- AND postcode is "75001" (AND logic between different filters)

**Notes:**
- Values are automatically deduplicated and sorted: `street+city+street` becomes `city+street`
- Spaces around `+` are ignored: `street + city` is equivalent to `street+city`
- Empty values are filtered out: `+street++` becomes `street`
- The maximum number of values per filter is configurable (default: 10, see [MAX_FILTER_VALUES](config.md#max_filter_values-int))

#### Response format

The response format follows the [GeoCodeJSON spec](https://github.com/geocoders/geocodejson-spec).
